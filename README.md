%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have put a demo of the “GL-TSVM” model with the “credit_approval” dataset 


Description of files:
---------------------
Main_GL_TSVM.m: This is the main file to run selected models on datasets. In the path variable specify the path to the folder containing the codes and datasets on which you wish to run the algorithm. 

GL_TSVM_function.m: the main file calls this file for the training and testing process.

kernelfunction.m: function to compute kernel. This function computes linear and RBF kernels.

---------------------------------------------------

The codes are not optimized for efficiency. The codes have been cleaned for better readability and documented and are not exactly the same as used in our paper. 
For the detailed experimental setup, please follow the paper. 
We have re-run and checked the codes only in a few datasets, so if you find any bugs/issues, please write to Mushir Akhtar (phd2101241004@iiti.ac.in).
